# Services


Services are abstracted functionality that can be used to fulfill certain actions in an abstract and pre-simplified way. For instance, a configuration reader service knows how to find a particular location in Asana to read configuration, which means that non-technical people can adjust how a script operates when it is run, or a service to manage local storage for generating diffs to tasks from a known previous state.
